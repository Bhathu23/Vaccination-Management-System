# Vaccination Management System

### **Background**

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. But some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Those with underlying medical conditions like diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer and old people are more likely to develop serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance is the best way to prevent and slow down transmission. There are several COVID-19 vaccines validated for use by WHO. The first mass vaccination program started in early December 2020.

Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. There is also some evidence that being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.

In Sri Lanka also government provide vaccination program as district and division wise. However, Sri Lanka has challenging vaccine and cold chain management landscape where factors such as scarcity of trained professionals, hot temperatures, and paucity of suitable arteries for transport pose considerable problems. As well as all paper work handle by manually and take long time to registration and vaccination.

This application will be very useful to developing an automated vaccination management system. And it’s time less work for user. We can introduce this application to hospitals and MOH offices. This application will provide all the details about the vaccination places, registration details, vaccine types. MOH and GS also can access and update their division details also. It’s very helpful for government and people. 

Objectives
The main objective of this project is to provide an easy automated vaccination management system for the users. The specific objectives are illustrated as below:
•	The website will show the vaccine details in a certain place and vaccination details.
•	The website will show the facilities about the vaccination program.
•	The users can easily get the details from the website.
•	Reducing the physical effort and saving the time of the user will be an added advantage of the website.
